# About Virtual Pets Amok

I created this virtual pet shelter program to help a user navigate a visit to a pet shelter. First they have the option of choosing whether they are there to volunteer, adopt a pet, or admit a pet.

If the visitor chooses to volunteer, they are then given the list of statuses of all pets, both organic and robotic. They are asked if they want to feed all organic pets, give water to all organic pets, oil all robotic pets, play with one pet, walk all dogs, clean all organic dogs' cages, or clean all organic cats' litter boxes. If they choose to play with a pet, they can see all of the pets' names and descriptions and decide which pet they want to play with.

Interacting with the pets updates their overall health and happiness levels. Additionally, cleaning their cages or litter boxes also positively affects their health and happiness levels. If their cages or litter boxes get below a 50 cleanliness level, the pets' health starts to decline.

If the visitor chooses to adopt a pet, they can see all of the pets names and descriptions to decide which pet they want to adopt. One adopted, the pet is "removed" from the shelter.

If the visitor chooses to admit a pet, they are prompted to enter the pet's name, description, and type, then the pet is added to the shelter and assigned a random amount for food, water, and boredom levels (if organic) or oil (if robotic), as someone might not know if they found a homeless pet.

If at any point, the user wants to quit, they have the ability to leave the program.
